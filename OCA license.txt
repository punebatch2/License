        The license key is pure text with multiple lines of same length. However, your email viewer may try to format it by adding or removing line breaks. This may cause the license key to become unrecognizable by ETS Viewer. In that case, you may extract license.txt file from the attached license.zip file, open license.txt file in Notepad, and copy the license key from there.

        By the way, ETS Viewer is capable of downloading the same license key automatically if you have Internet connection. Just supply your Order ID (ENT181117-6703-78112) and Emailid (humsa.hk14408@gmail.com) in Automatic Licensing tab and it will do the rest. You may download Question Bank files and ETS Viewer application from http://enthuware.com 

        Please keep this key safe because it cannot be retrieved after 6 months of purchase from our servers.
